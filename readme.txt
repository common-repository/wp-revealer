== Installation ==
1. You can either use the automatic plugin installer or your FTP program to upload it to your wp-content/plugins directory
the top-level folder. Don\'t just upload all the php files and put them in `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress

There is no real setup required to use this plugin. Simply locate the content on your post or page that you want to hide and place [reveal-after-delay x = minutes.seconds] in front and [/reveal-after-delay] at the end. Replace ‘X” with the time delay that you want to hide that text before it is revealed.

Example: This button will display at 12 minutes and 30 seconds after the wordpress page loads:

[reveal-after-delay x = 12.30] BUY NOW BUTTON [/reveal-after-delay]
